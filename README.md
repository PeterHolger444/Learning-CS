# Learning CS

This repo contains a collection of notes and explanations for various topics in computer science and programming. Related topics are grouped by the folder with the topic name.

I made this repo so that I can have a starting point for research when I want to re-learn these topics in future. However, I included links to related articles, videos and tutorials in almost every notes. So, you may read these notes and learn something useful from the resources.
